    <p>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p>

    <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.</p>
